# WebGL-SolarSystem

**This Project was made in collaboration with two other classmates:**<br>
Pedro Silva <br>
Renan Silva <br>

## What we learned
 - webgl
 - 3d object implementation
 - textures
 - animation
 - shaders
 - light

## Interactions:
1. Pressing the keys ‘1’ and ‘2’ should reset the camera position to the current position of the Earth and the Sun, respectively
2. Pressing the key ‘o’ should allow viewing the orbits of the planets
3. The arrow keys and the mouse should allow moving the camera through the 3D scene
